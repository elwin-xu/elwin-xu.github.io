          <h1>Zixuan Xu</h1>
          <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
          <p>Graduated from one of the top universities in China, I started my career as a software engineer in a leading consulting firm in China developing structural design software for professional civil engineers. I used MFC on Visual Studio and source control tools including Git to collaborate with my teammates. The team adopted agile development methodology, enabling me to have a lot of interactions with customers and teammates.</p>
          <p>Back in college, I had experience using an open source program call Yade on Linux to simulate the mechanical behaviour of a membrane structure. The program was written in C++, and users can interact with the program via Python scripts or commands. From there, I learnt some Linux basics and had exposure to some open source projects hosted on Github.</p>
          <p>I have development experience on various operating systems including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. I have a strong passion for designing and using software as I'm fascinated by the way we interact with digital devices. My technical skills of software and supportive personality allow me to troubleshoot many software-related problems for people around me.</p>
          <p>My career objective is to become a highly motivated software engineer dedicated to developing software with the highest usability and the best user experience, who has an elegant and efficient coding style and appreciates the art of software craftsmanship, who is always passionate about exciting new technologies, with the ability to break a project into small achievable steps.</p>

            <p>After coming back from teaching a JavaScript workshop, I felt inspired to create something just for fun. I realized that of all the content/lorem ipsum generators available, there was nothing for HBO’s The Wire fans. I searched for <a href="http://thewireipsum.com" target="_blank">thewireipsum.com</a> domain and it was available! Generate some content for your projects today.</p>
